# FloodRiskAnalysis
Rivers are the lifeline of our cities but occasionally, they can become threads to buildings, infrastructure and human lives. Flood events can show up annually, but bigger and unexpected events hit the local community hard and bring about huge damage. Authorities need an overview, what areas could be affected if weather conditions like heavy rain are recognized. An important tool to take measures in advance are flood risk maps.

# Definition

Risk = probability of occurrence * expectation of damage The goal is not to show regions most likely to be flooded, but visualize areas are most likely to experience damage to infrastructure, buildings and citizen by floods.
